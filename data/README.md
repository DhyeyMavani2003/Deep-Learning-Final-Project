# Data

We use the TweetEval dataset, which is the benchmark associated with the Findings of EMNLP 2020 paper "TweetEval: Unified Benchmark and Comparative Evaluation for Tweet Classification". More details on the data description can be found in the `./data/tweeteval` folder's README file. 

In the future we plan to use data from other sources as well, and thus we created this structure in order to ensure that we can modularize our data and our work properly.
