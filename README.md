## Abstract

This project aims to analyze sentiment in tweets data using Deep Learning models, specifically BERT. The process involves cleaning and preprocessing the tweets data, followed by fine-tuning the BERT model to improve sentiment prediction accuracy. Additionally, other Deep Learning models will be explored to compare their performance with BERT. By leveraging the power of Deep Learning, the project seeks to gain insights into the sentiment patterns present in the tweets data and provide valuable information for sentiment analysis tasks.
